This package contains functions for rendering xaringan slides to different formats, including html, pdf, png, gif, pptx, and mp4, as well as a 'social' output, a png of the first slide re-sized for sharing on social media.

**Looking for xaringanBuilder?**
The package formerly known as xaringanBuilder is now **renderthis**.
If you need to install xaringanBuilder under the previous package name, [see the instructions below](#installing-xaringanbuilder).

## Installation

You can install the current version of renderthis from GitHub:

```{r}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jhelvy/renderthis")
```

Some output formats require additional packages, and each format will provide instructions about how to install any missing dependencies. You can also choose to install renderthis with all of its dependencies:

```{r}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jhelvy/renderthis", dependencies = TRUE)
```

**Note**: To get the most out of renderthis, we recommend installing the package **with dependencies** and making sure that you have a [local installation of Google Chrome](https://jhelvy.github.io/renderthis/articles/renderthis-setup.html#local-chrome-installation).

## Usage

```{r child="man/fragments/usage.Rmd", eval = TRUE}

```

Learn more about renderthis in the [Get Started article](https://jhelvy.github.io/renderthis/articles/renderthis.html).

## Citation Information

If you use this package in a publication, I would greatly appreciate it if you cited it. You can get the citation information by typing `citation("renderthis")` into R:

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, results='asis'}
citation("renderthis")
```

## Installing xaringanBuilder

You can install the xaringanBuilder package as it was just prior to the name change with:

```r
remotes::install_github("jhelvy/renderthis@v0.0.9")
```

Even though the install command mentions `renderthis`, the package will be installed as xaringanBuilder.
