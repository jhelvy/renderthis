\title{Build xaringan slides as html file.}
\usage{
to_html(input, output_file = NULL, self_contained = FALSE, rmd_args = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Path to Rmd file of xaringan slides.}

\item{output_file}{The name of the output file. If using `NULL` then the
output file name will be based on file name for the input file. If a file
name is provided, a path to the output file can also be provided.}

\item{self_contained}{Should the output file be a self-contained HTML file
where all images, CSS and JavaScript are included directly in the output
file? This option, when `TRUE`, provides you with a single HTML file that
you can share with others, but it may be very large. This feature is
enabled by default when the `output_file` is written in a directory other
than the one containing the `input` R Markdown file.}

\item{rmd_args}{A list of arguments passed to [rmarkdown::render()].}
}
\description{
Build xaringan slides as html file. Essentially the same thing as
[rmarkdown::render()] with `output_format = "xaringan::moon_reader"`,
except that the `self_contained` option is forced to `TRUE` if the HTML file
is built into a directory other than the one containing `input`.

# Build html from Rmd file
to_html("slides.Rmd")
